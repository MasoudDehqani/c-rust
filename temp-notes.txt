- building VS compinling

- C compiler looks for 'main' function to start compilation. This particular function is the entry point of the C program.
- The 'main' function is the entry point of Rust programs too.

- Both C and Rust return 0 for successful compilation of the program and return an integer other than 0 for failed compilation

- In C the main function mostly does not take any parameters. But it can take argc and argv as parametes whose valus are provided at runtime by
command-line arguments

- naming convention in both C and Rust is sanke_case

- screaming snake case -> SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- screaming snake case is used in both C and Rust for naming constants

- compiling and running are separate in both C and Rust

- C can integrate assembly language code into its codes. It is possible to write assembly code in C code
- Rust can integrate C codes into its codes

- These are possible in C, but not in Rust:
int var1, var2, var3;
var1 = var2 = var3 = 10;
int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;

- These are possible in Rust, but not in C:
let x = 1;
let x = 2;
(this is called shadowing in Rust)

- range -> upper and lower limit of some set of data

- decimal number system -> base 10 number system
example:
568 -> 5 * (10**2) + 6 * (10**1) + 8 * (10**0)

- binary number system -> base 2 number system
example:
1001 -> 1 * (2**3) + 0 * (2**2) + 0 * (2**1) + 1 * (2**0) 
the binary example above is a 4-bit data

- each digit in each number system has a place value

- range of 4-bit data:
minimum -> 0000 -> 0
maximum -> 1111 -> 15
so range of 4 bit data is -> 0000 to 1111
converting it to decimal -> 0 to 15
- formula to calculate the maximum is -> (2**n) - 1
(n is the number of bits)

- scientific notation -> 10e3 -> 10**3

- In two's complement representation, the range of a 2-byte data (16 bits) is:
unsigned -> 0 to (2**16) - 1 -> 0 to 65535
signed -> -32768 to +32767
the formula for calculating the maximum in signed -> -(2**(n-1)) to (2**(n-1)) - 1
example for 2-byte (16-bit):
-(2**(16-1)) to (2**(16-1)) - 1
-32768 to +32767

- There are 3 ways to represent negative numbers in computer
1. signed magnitude
2. one's (1's) complement
3. two's (2's) complement

Integer types in C and Rust:
- In C, there is only an 'int' type for integers, with some modifiers (short, long, signed, unsigned)
- In Rust, there are separate types for integers (u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128, isize, usize)
